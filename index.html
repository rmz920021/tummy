    <h1>Biography</h1>
    <p>Michael was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, on March 15, 1964, and frequently talks about his loneliness as a child. He claims to be of English, Irish, Scottish and German ancestry. He claims to have been a child star on the program Fundle Bundle, but this was later proven to be false.

He was hired as a salesman at Dunder Mifflin on May 6, 1992 and proved to be extremely effective, which resulted in him being promoted to regional manager.

Despite being a successful salesman, Michael is shown to be an incompetent manager and tries to inject his personal feelings into the work environment, and has few relationships outside the office. He overestimates the importance of his co-workers, and can't understand why they're not enjoying themselves, as he believes an office is a "place where dreams come true." Despite this, Michael genuinely cares for his employees and tries to help them when they have problems.

Michael constantly desires to be at the center of attention, which result in him being slightly selfish. For example, when he breaks his leg in the episode "The Injury", he expects Pam Beesly and Ryan Howard to tend to his every need, despite Dwight Schrute's more serious concussion. When invited to be an usher at Phyllis Vance's wedding, he believes himself to be the main act of the event and gets upset when he is upstaged by Phyllis's elderly father.

Michael is irresponsible at finances, and at one point was so heavily in debt that he had to take a second job as a telemarketer. Oscar Martinez creates a chart of Michael's spending habits, and chides him for spending money on things "nobody ever needs", like multiple magic sets and a set of fishing equipment. Eventually, Michael is forced to declare bankruptcy (which he only thinks requires standing up and saying "I declare bankruptcy!").

Due to his overall lack of common sense, Michael is frequently abused by his peers and is the butt of many jokes, and takes offense when he realizes he's being wronged. Similarly, he tends to unintentionally offend people, but will usually apologize when he realizes he has insulted someone, notably in the episode "Gay Witch Hunt", when he realizes that the term "faggy" hurt Oscar's feelings. Even though he is generally oblivious to criticism, Michael has limits to his patience, and leaves to question the extent of the offense he can acknowledge.

In the episode "The Meeting", it is revealed that Michael doesn't care for the betterment for his employees or himself, believing it would put his job at jeopardy, and turns down a promotion that would put Jim in his position, and sabotages him with a bad recommendation because he believes he'll get fired if Jim is promoted. He eventually gives Jim a co-manager position to avoid losing him.

After leaving Dunder Mifflin, Michael is appointed to be the Director of Paper Distribution for the Department of Natural Resources in Boulder, Colorado. </p>
    
        <h1>Personality and Management</h1> 
        <p> Despite his effective sales skills, Michael is lacking in almost all other skills. Jim once created a graph that shows Michaels spends 80% of his time "distracting others", 19% "procrastination", and 1% "critical thinking." He also added the he inflated the "critical thinking" section so people could see it on the graph. Michael's laid back approach results in low workplace productivity, particularly when he places personal interests as a priority over work. To avoid being disciplined for his actions, Michael resorts to scapegoating his employees to cover for himself. Michael described the Scranton branch as "The cool, fun branch... Like Animal House", and is upset when a Dunder Mifflin Utica salesman tells him that Scranton is "worse than Camden."</p>
